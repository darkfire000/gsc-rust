# Post Install Files

This folder contains any files that need to be installed onto the game server _after_ the initial deploy & install. For example, banlists, config files mods, plugins, etc.

Once the server is installed & running, copy the files in this folder into their corosponding location in the `server_files` folder and reboot the server.
